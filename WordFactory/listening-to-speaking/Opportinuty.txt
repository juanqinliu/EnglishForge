I completely agree with you. As this is the final competition, we should not split hairs or rigidly define talent solely by fame or achievements.  I also have great respect for the people of Malaysia, who, despite extremely difficult conditions, have achieved remarkable accomplishments through their own efforts.  I believe that as long as a person, starting from their given environment and conditions, achieves something through their own efforts, this should be considered a form of success and personal development. Taking this opportunity, we can reflect on our own personal growth. I believe two key external factors shape our opportunities. The first is the broader historical context, and the second is the environment. What do we mean by the historical context? As ordinary individuals carried along by the tide of our times, we are inevitably influenced by it. Sometimes this influence comes unexpectedly; at other times, it reflects long-term historical trends.  We have witnessed many changes of our time, such as greater gender equality, the expansion of higher education, and the growth of China’s economy—all of which have created opportunities for us. Ultimately, the point I wish to make is that whether a person seizes an opportunity is not always determined by personal effort alone, but often by the opportunity itself. I grew up in Guizhou, and my earliest mentors were two of my neighbors, whom I called uncle and aunt. They were educated youths from Shanghai in the 1960s.  They were sent to Guizhou as part of the “Up to the Mountains and Down to the Countryside” Movement.  I used to do my math homework at their home, growing up step by step under their guidance. It was not until many years later that I realized how precious it was to encounter college-educated intellectuals from the previous generation. They gave me something invaluable—a broader perspective. At that age, everyone around me believed that only students who performed poorly in science would choose the humanities. While everyone else encouraged me to pursue science, they advised me to stay true to what I genuinely loved. Although my opportunity to study in Hong Kong was partly due to my own efforts, it was also because universities there had begun recruiting students from Guizhou. However, the awareness that led me onto this path began with that very opportunity. There are some things in this world that cannot be changed by effort alone; they require someone to awaken them. That is what we call the broader perspective. Thank you.
